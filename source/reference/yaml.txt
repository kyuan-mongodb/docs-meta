.. default-domain:: mongodb

Before the DOP team created ``procedure`` directive, our documentation
team used Yet Another Markup Language (YAML) when writing steps for a
guide. Eventually, we'll convert all YAML files into ``procedure``
directives.

.. note::

   This is NOT the preffered way to write steps today. See the <TODO:
   procedure-directive-ref> to learn how to use the preffered way.

To see if the repository you're working out of uses YAML, look for the
``includes`` folder and see if any files end in ``.yaml``.
